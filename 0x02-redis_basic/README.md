## Description
This project introduces Redis, a high-performance in-memory data structure store commonly used as a database, cache, and message broker. The project focuses on learning how to use Redis in Python through the redis-py library, implementing basic operations, managing data persistence, and building a simple cache system.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, i was able to:

- Understand what Redis is and its typical use cases.
- Explain how Redis differs from traditional databases.
- Perform basic Redis operations like setting, getting, and deleting keys.
- Implement caching in Python using Redis.
- Work with data persistence in Redis.
- Use Redis data types such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets.
